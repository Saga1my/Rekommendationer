        <h3>STAR WARS</h3>
        <p>Star Wars is a movie franchise that consists of 9 movies. Altough there are 2 other starwars movies but they dont count in the official franchise. There are also a couple of tv shows, some animated, some not. It has been the most popular movie franchise ever since the release of its first movie in 1977. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My personal favorites in this franchise are probably the 3,4,5,6th movies. I must admit that there are some really bad movies as well but i truly believe that it is a franchise that everyone should watch atleast once. There is something for everyone in these movies, romacnce, action, friendship and loss.  </p>
